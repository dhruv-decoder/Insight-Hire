## Insight-Hire ( A Interview Feedback Sentiment Analyser)

### Description
I've developed a powerful sentiment analysis tool called "Insight Hire" that leverages cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning techniques to streamline the interview evaluation process. This application analyzes interview transcripts or videos and provides valuable insights into a candidate's sentiment, enabling hiring teams to make more informed decisions.
Insight Hire utilizes OpenAI's state-of-the-art language models (GPT-3.5 and Whisper) for sentiment analysis and transcript generation. It offers a user-friendly Streamlit interface, allowing users to input text or YouTube video links and receive data-driven sentiment scores, detailed feedback, and downloadable reports.
